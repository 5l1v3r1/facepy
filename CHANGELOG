CHANGELOG

v0.6
- Search results may now be paged.
- 'facepy.VERSION' is now 'facepy.__version__'

v0.5.1
- It is now considerably easier to create signed requests programmatically.

v0.5
- Facepy now returns the complete API response instead of just its "data" attribute.

- Fixed a bug that caused a KeyError if the user's locale or country is missing from the signed request.

v0.4.0
- Added support for parsing and reverse-engineering signed requests.
- Added support for file-like objects in POST and PUT.

v0.3.1
- Fixed a bug that prevented the 'page' argument to GraphAPI#get from working
  correctly.

v0.3
- GraphAPI#get now has a new argument 'page', which returns a generator
  that iterates over each page of results.

v0.2.3
- The GraphAPI class may now be initialized by signed request.

v0.2.2
- Fix a bug that caused non-JSON data (e.g. pictures) to raise a ValueError.

v0.2.1
- Fix a bug that caused a TypeError if the 'path' argument is an integer.

v0.2
- Exceptions have been refactored:

    # Pre-v0.2.0
    from facepy import GraphAPI
    from facepy.exceptions import APIError
    
    try:
        GraphAPI().get('johannes.gorset')
    except APIError:
        [...]
        
    # Post-v0.2.0
    from facepy import GraphAPI
    
    try:
        GraphAPI().get('johannes.gorset)
    except GraphAPI.Error:
        [...]
